            <p className="about-text">
              I am originally from Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª. I've been in the US for almost
              8 years now. I have a bachelors degree in business administration
              from UNE in Caracas (Venezuela) and had different professional
              roles in family business, entreprenurail ventures and big 4 firms
              (Accenture & EY). Technology has always been a passion of mine in
              many ways like innovation, computer science, video games, etc. So,
              I decided to persue this long time passion with intent and here I
              am learning and creating web interfaces. It's been an amazing
              challenge that I embrace fully and want to keep growing in this
              area. <hr />I also enjoy making music and been a self taught
              drummer for many years and being in bands was always a way to
              connect with other and I hope tech will make that possible too! ðŸš€

              I am a full-stack developer that began my journey in front-end,
              then evolved into backend, and now learning full stack
              applications, and my latest endeavor is to learn cloud
              infrastructure. Every guru says find a niche and stick with it...
              but in reality you find many niches.. and things change along the
              way, but all systems will needs a management of its systems and
              will be in some sort of cloud, hence that's why I am learning
              Cloud infrastructure. This is not a home, but rather a comfy place
              you find in your journey. Thing is journey is not a destination
              but a process, so I am gonna try to enjoy it as much as possible
              while learning all of this technologies.
