            <p className="about-text">
              Originally from Venezuela ðŸ‡»ðŸ‡ª, I've called the U.S. home for nearly
              8 years. Holding a bachelor's degree in Business Administration
              from UNE in Caracas, my career has spanned family businesses,
              entrepreneurial ventures, and roles at firms like Accenture and
              EY. My passion for technologyâ€”spanning innovation, computer
              science, and video gamesâ€”led me to pursue web development. This
              journey has been a rewarding challenge, and I'm committed to
              continuous growth in this field.

            <h1>MY MISSION</h1>
            <p className="about-text">
              As a full-stack developer, I began with front-end technologies,
              expanded into back-end development, and now specialize in
              comprehensive web solutions. Recognizing the importance of cloud
              infrastructure, I'm dedicated to mastering it to provide scalable
              and efficient services. I believe in embracing the journey of
              learning and aim to enjoy every step while integrating diverse
              technologies.
