              <p className="">
                My passion for tech began as a teen tinkering with my PC, I
                would would tinker with it, put it appart, update the OS and
                break it. I always wanted to update it's components as newer
                games always demanded more and more. Then after cell phones came
                around and made us use personal computers less and less I had a
                different approach towards innovation and mobile technologies.
                Years came and went and after the pandemic I began some
                soulsearch and reconnected to those times and persued some
                trainig developing websites. It was the hot thing at the moment
                so I signed for my first React bootcamp and learned some basic
                react and react netive principle to build basic apps. After that
                experience I decided to get an education in software development
                to persue a career in this field and help solve real wolrd
                problems as well as put my energy into learning into that talent
                that I had when I was a kid. Now I can develop full stack apps
                and I keep studying so I can build reliable solutions as well as
                an interest in clouds projects with a focus on design. I stride
                yo make aesthetically pleasing interfaces that have and
                beautiful look and feel that is a very rewarding aspect of
                development which is design.
